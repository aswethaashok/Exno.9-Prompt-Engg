### Aim: 
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation

### Algorithm: 

1] Select a base scene for AI video generation.

2] Apply Zero-shot prompting to generate the first version.

3] Apply Few-shot prompting using image/video references.

4] Use Chain-of-thought prompting to create a step-wise transformation video.

5] Use Role-based prompting to re-imagine the scene from a specific creative perspective.

6] Compare the outputs visually and analyze how each prompting technique influences the final video.

7] Document observations and conclusions.

### Concept Title:

“Haunted Passage — Exploring Prompting Techniques in Halloween-Themed Video Generation”

### Core Video Concept (Use Case for Experiment):

A dark, haunted Halloween forest is used as the base scene. A car drives slowly through a windy, creepy forest road, while costumed Halloween characters stand silently on both sides. Using this same scene, different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) are applied to generate multiple video variations. The experiment demonstrates how each prompt style changes the atmosphere, intensity, color mood, and cinematic feel of the haunted environment.


### Master Prompt (for creating the video):

You can use this with any video-generation AI model (Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Krea, Luma, etc.)

### ✅  Tool-Specific Prompts:

#### ► Runway Gen-2 Prompt
```
“Transform this base street-walk clip into 4 styles: dreamy cinematic, cyberpunk-watercolor hybrid, stepwise evolving transformation, and sci-fi director’s reimagining.”
```
#### ► Pika Labs Prompt
```
“Take the original walking footage and generate four contrasting styles using zero-shot, few-shot references, step-by-step visual evolution, and director-style sci-fi action.”
```
#### ► Luma Dream Machine Prompt
```
“Recreate the same walking scene in cinematic, artistic hybrid, progressive transformation, and sci-fi director modes.”
```
#### ► Krea Video Prompt
```
“Apply four prompt methods—zero-shot, reference blending, chained transformation, and role-based directing—on the same simple walking clip.”
```
### 🎥 Main Prompt Text:
```

“Create a dark, haunted Halloween-themed cinematic video.
The scene is a narrow forest road surrounded by tall, twisted trees shaking violently in heavy wind.
Dead leaves swirl across the road, fog creeps between the tree trunks, and the atmosphere feels cold and eerie.
Both sides of the road are filled with people dressed in Halloween costumes—zombies, witches, ghosts, scarecrows—standing silently and staring as a car drives through them.
Some figures slowly turn their heads as the car passes, illuminated only by the car’s headlights.
The car moves straight down the road, cutting through dense fog, with shadows flickering from branches above.
Add glowing jack-o’-lanterns, hanging lanterns, and faint whispers carried by the wind.
Camera style: slow, smooth tracking shot from behind the car with cinematic depth-of-field, dramatic lighting, and high contrast.
Overall mood: haunted, unsettling, atmospheric, Halloween horror aesthetic.”

```
### Observation Table:

| Prompting Technique | Description of Output                         | Strengths                 | Weaknesses              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Zero-shot           | Basic transformation without examples         | Fast, simple              | Less controlled         |
| Few-shot            | Style matches reference images/videos         | High accuracy, consistent | Needs reference data    |
| Chain-of-thought    | Gradual evolution in steps                    | Detailed control          | Longer generation       |
| Role-based          | Follows creative persona (director, animator) | Rich creativity           | Sometimes unpredictable |

### Output:

### Result: 

Different prompting techniques produced distinct video outputs even when using the same base scene. Zero-shot gave simple changes, few-shot provided style accuracy, chain-of-thought gave stepwise control, and role-based produced highly creative variations.
